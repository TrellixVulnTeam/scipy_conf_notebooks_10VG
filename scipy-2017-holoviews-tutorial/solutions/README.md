The notebooks in this directory are those presented during the tutorial,
including exercise solutions. The following snapshots of these notebooks
are available online via [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org).

Note that some of the output in notebooks 3,4,5,6 and 7 requires a live
server to support the interactivity offered by HoloViews widgets and
Bokeh tools.
