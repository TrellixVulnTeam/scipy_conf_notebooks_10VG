The notebooks in this directory are also available for viewing online via [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org). 
Note that some output requires a live server which means you won't see the intended behavior without running a notebook server, as
detailed in the [README](https://github.com/ioam/scipy-2017-holoviews-tutorial/blob/master/README.rst).
