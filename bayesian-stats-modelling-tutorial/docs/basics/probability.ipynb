    "The same rules of probability apply, in that the total \"mass\" or \"density\" assigned must equal to 1,\n",
    "and that the values must be distributed across the valid outcome values (support).\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the notation where $C_i$ refers to the $i$th random variable modelling coin $i$, and the outcomes are $H$ and $T$, the joint pairs are:\n",
